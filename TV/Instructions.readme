TV Reciever and Game Console
-----------

This script handles displaying different types of scenes. these can be either 
an animated scene, or an interactive scene. it expects a block with a textsurface
and "TV" in the name. (ideally "TV" as the custom name to avoid looking for it)

this script will work with tv broadcasters that can transmit scenes to this TV reciever.
it will also maybe include a couple simple games that can be played on the TV.
